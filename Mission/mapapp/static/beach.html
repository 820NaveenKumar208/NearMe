    My apologies for the confusion. It appears there might be a misunderstanding. Muttukadu is primarily known as a village in the Kanchipuram district of Tamil Nadu, situated along the East Coast Road near Chennai. However, it's possible that there might be a place with a similar name in Thoothukudi (Tuticorin) district or nearby areas.

If you're specifically referring to Muttukadu in Thoothukudi, it might be a smaller locality or village within that district. Unfortunately, without further information, it's challenging to provide specific details about Muttukadu in Thoothukudi.

If there's indeed a Muttukadu in Thoothukudi, it might share similarities with the one near Chennai, possibly featuring local attractions, cultural sites, or natural landmarks. If you have any specific questions or details you're looking for regarding Muttukadu in Thoothukudi, please feel free to provide more information, and I'll do my best to assist you.
