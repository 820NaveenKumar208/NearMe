As of my last update in January 2022, there is limited information available about a place called Muttayyapuram specifically in Thoothukudi district. It's possible that Muttayyapuram could be a small locality or village within the Thoothukudi district, but without further details, it's challenging to provide specific information.

If Muttayyapuram is indeed a place in Thoothukudi, it might be a lesser-known area or a locality primarily known to the local residents. It may not have significant tourist attractions or landmarks widely recognized outside the region.

If you have specific questions or details you're looking for regarding Muttayyapuram in Thoothukudi, please provide more information, and I'll do my best to assist you further.
