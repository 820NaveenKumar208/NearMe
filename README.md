    My apologies for the confusion. It appears there might be a misunderstanding. Muttukadu is primarily known as a village in the Kanchipuram district of Tamil Nadu, situated along the East Coast Road near Chennai. However, it's possible that there might be a place with a similar name in Thoothukudi (Tuticorin) district or nearby areas.

If you're specifically referring to Muttukadu in Thoothukudi, it might be a smaller locality or village within that district. Unfortunately, without further information, it's challenging to provide specific details about Muttukadu in Thoothukudi.

If there's indeed a Muttukadu in Thoothukudi, it might share similarities with the one near Chennai, possibly featuring local attractions, cultural sites, or natural landmarks. If you have any specific questions or details you're looking for regarding Muttukadu in Thoothukudi, please feel free to provide more information, and I'll do my best to assist you.

As of my last update in January 2022, there isn't specific information available regarding a GRT Hostel in Thoothukudi. GRT Hotels and Resorts is a well-known hospitality chain in South India, but their properties are primarily hotels rather than hostels.

If you're specifically looking for accommodation in Thoothukudi, you may want to explore other hotels or guesthouses in the area. There are several options available ranging from budget stays to more upscale accommodations.

You can use online travel platforms or hotel booking websites to search for available accommodations in Thoothukudi during your planned visit. These platforms often provide detailed information about the facilities, location, and guest reviews to help you make an informed decision. Additionally, contacting local tourism offices or travel agencies may also provide insights or recommendations for suitable accommodations in Thoothukudi.

As of my last update in January 2022, there is limited information available about a place called Muttayyapuram specifically in Thoothukudi district. It's possible that Muttayyapuram could be a small locality or village within the Thoothukudi district, but without further details, it's challenging to provide specific information.

If Muttayyapuram is indeed a place in Thoothukudi, it might be a lesser-known area or a locality primarily known to the local residents. It may not have significant tourist attractions or landmarks widely recognized outside the region.

If you have specific questions or details you're looking for regarding Muttayyapuram in Thoothukudi, please provide more information, and I'll do my best to assist you further.
